## Description

This exercise involved the creation of a single-page application (SPA) following the requiremenets of the fictional company, 'Useless Facts'. As requested, the SPA generates facts one by one at the touch of a button and also allows users to add their favorite facts to a separate section of the SPA for future reference. When accessing their favorites section, users can read their saved facts, delete them all, or return to the main section to reveal more facts. 


## Technologies

- Visual Studio Code (HTML & CSS)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Node
- Vitest

## Testing

Testing involved verifying the the correct rendering of the CSS file as well as the the API's response status. All tests passed. To perform these same tests, it is necessary to install Node.js and follow the guidelines on vitest.dev.
